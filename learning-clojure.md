# Learning Clojure

There are several lessons, for a variety of basic topics of Clojure. Each lesson will have a little bit of an explanation, which you can find in the appropriate page and a practical part.
The practical part can be found in the appropriate clojure file under the `src` folder. In these files you will need to finish the implementation of a few functions. In order to test your implementation, you will run a command from the terminal which is going to run some tests. When all tests pass, you finished the lesson!
