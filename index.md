Welcome to the Academy, where we learn to wield the weapons of a more civilized age.

This site has two parts:

- **Learning the basic of Clojure**, which is a rework of [Functional Programming in Clojure](https://iloveponies.github.io/) by Juhana Laurinharju and Jani Rahkola (and how I learned the basics of the language), adapted to the state of the Clojure ecosystem in 2020.
- **Clojure in real life**, a series of practical tips on getting started with the language. Consider this an opinionated list of what to do and not to do to build a real-world Clojure project. 

The source of this repo is available at https://www.github.com/Heliosmaster/academy 

## Getting started


- Choose an Editor with `paredit` support (TODO)
- Follow the [Getting started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) page from the Clojure website `clj`
- Verify that you have a REPL running by typing `clj` on your command line. You should see, after a couple of seconds, this output

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

All is well, Press `Ctrl-D` and exit from the REPL.

# Learning the basics of Clojure

There are several lessons, for a variety of basic topics of Clojure. Each lesson will have a little bit of an explanation, which you can find in the appropriate page and a practical part.
The practical part can be found in the appropriate clojure file under the `src` folder. In these files you will need to finish the implementation of a few functions. In order to test your implementation, you will run a command from the terminal which is going to run some tests. When all tests pass, you finished the lesson!
