Welcome to the Academy, where we learn to wield the weapons of a more civilized age.

This site has two parts:

- **[Learning Clojure](learning-clojure)**, which is a fork/rework of [Functional Programming in Clojure]
- **Clojure in real life**, a series of practical tips on getting started with the language. Consider this a list of opinions and advice to build a real-world Clojure project and have a ton of fun.

The source of this repo is available at [https://github.com/Heliosmaster/academy](https://github.com/Heliosmaster/academy)

## Why another course?
There's a ton of great Clojure learning resources, but I had a really good experience with [Functional Programming in Clojure]. I've learned the language with the same course in 2014 and I wanted to refresh it for 2020. I liked the simplicity and effectiveness of the exercises and I think I can expand on that, learning from my experience over these last few years of working full-time in Clojure.
The second part is more meant to be a collections of notes / post with practical advice. I've heard from newcomers to the language that they felt a bit lost due to the lack of practical guidance in making something useful, and I want to help address that.

## Getting started

- Choose an Editor with `paredit` support (TODO)
- Follow the [Getting started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) page from the Clojure website `clj`
- Verify that you have a REPL running by typing `clj` on your command line. You should see, after a couple of seconds, this output

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

All is well, Press `Ctrl-D` and exit from the REPL.
