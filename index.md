This, for now, it just an adaptation of [Functional Programming in Clojure](https://iloveponies.github.io/) by Juhana Laurinharju and Jani Rahkola, and originally part of the CS study of the University of Helsinki.

This series of exercises is how I learned the basics of the language, and now I will pass it on.


## How to do this course

There are several lessons, for a variety of basic topics of Clojure. Each lesson will have a little bit of an explanation, which you can find in the appropriate page and a practical part.
The practical part can be found in the appropriate clojure file under the `src` folder. In these files you will need to finish the implementation of a few functions. In order to test your implementation, you will run a command from the terminal which is going to run some tests. When all tests pass, you finished the lesson!


## Getting started


- Choose an Editor with `paredit` support (TODO)
- Follow the [Getting started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) page from the Clojure website `clj`
- Verify that you have a REPL running by typing `clj` on your command line. You should see, after a couple of seconds, this output

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

All is well, Press `Ctrl-D` and exit from the REPL.
