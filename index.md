Welcome to the Academy, where we learn to wield the weapons of a more civilized age.

This site has two parts:

- **[Learning Clojure](learning-clojure)**, which is a rework of [Functional Programming in Clojure](https://iloveponies.github.io/) by Juhana Laurinharju and Jani Rahkola (and how I learned the basics of the language), adapted to the state of the Clojure ecosystem in 2020.
- **Clojure in real life**, a series of practical tips on getting started with the language. Consider this an opinionated list of what to do and not to do to build a real-world Clojure project. 

The source of this repo is available at [https://github.com/Heliosmaster/academy](https://github.com/Heliosmaster/academy) 

## Getting started


- Choose an Editor with `paredit` support (TODO)
- Follow the [Getting started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) page from the Clojure website `clj`
- Verify that you have a REPL running by typing `clj` on your command line. You should see, after a couple of seconds, this output

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

All is well, Press `Ctrl-D` and exit from the REPL.
